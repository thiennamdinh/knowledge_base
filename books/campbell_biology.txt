Chapter 1 - Introduction: Themes in the Study of Life

- book focuses on emergent properties at each level
- levels of biological organization:
  - molecules
  - organelles
  - cells
  - tissues
  - organ systems
  - organisms
  - populations
  - communities
  - ecosystems
  - the biosphere
- the transfer of energy is crucial to understanding biology
- "Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution
- modern scientists debate where protists belong
  - kingdoms are obviously not very well-defined

Chapter 2 - The Chemistry of Life

- elements of life == oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen
- carbon central because of 4 valence electrons

Chapter 3 - Water and Life

- four key properties of water
  - cohesion of water molecules
    - helpful for transportation, plant capillary action
  - moderation of temperature by water
  - floating of ice on liquid water
    - allows acquatic ecosystems to survive winter
  - the solvent of life
- acids supply +H, bases supply OH-

Chapter 4 - Carbon and the Molecular Diversity of Life

- original synthetic premodial carbon experiment by Stanley Miller 1953
- variation in organic molecules caused by differently shaped isomers
  - include structural isomers, cis-trans isomers, and enantiomers
  - this are caused by the position of carbon-bonding elements
- sugars are primary unit of food that gets assembled/broken downj

Chapter 5 - The Structure and Function of Large Biological Molecules

- frequently created/destroyed via dehydraction and hydrolysis reactions
- saturated, unsaturated, trans fats refer to chemical structure of HC chain
- lipid membranes formed by back-to-back layers of phospholipid walls
  - arranged so hydrophilic sides facing water, hydrophophoic faces internally
- enzymes speed up specific reactions without being consumed
- four levels of protein structure:
  - primary: linear arrangement of amino acids
  - secondary: locally stable regions (still kind of linear)
  - tertiary: 3-D arrangement of amino acid chain
    - picture tangled rope stabilized by side chain interactions
  - quaternary: different tertiary structures arranged to form final protein
- macromolecules recognize eachother by seeing if the "fit"
  - this happens on exposed docking sites of the protein
  - determined by the entire coding of the structure

Chapter 6 - A Tour of the Cell

- layers of microscopic observation instruments:
  - light microscope - down to bacteria
  - electron microscope - down to protenines
    - scanning electron microscope - scan surface
    - transmission electron microscope - scan internal by staining structures
- organelles often measured (rather brutishly) using centrifuge
- nucleus stores all DNA + messenger RNA
  - chromosomes usually all tangled up until reproduction
- endoplasmic reticulum
  - accounts for more than half of total membrane in most cells
  - smooth ER synthesizes lipds, metabolism of carbs, drug detox
  - rough ER (studded with ribosomes) secrete a bunch of protein
- Golgi apparatus
  - "warehouse for receiving, sorting, shipping, and manufacturing [proteins]"
  - proteins arrive and are bundled into transport vesicles
  - apparently, molecular "id tags" on vesicles act as ZIP codes
    - note: this is pretty crazy
- lysosome
  - digests food vacuoles
  - also serves to recycle damage organelles
  - a bunch are floating around at any given time
- mitochondria
  - use oxygen to generate ATP from sguars, fats, and other fuels
  - found in nearly all eukaryotic cells including plants
  - probably originated as symbiotic external organism that lived in cells
  - reproduce independently throughout lifetime of cell
- chloroplast
  - use solar energy to synthesize organic compounds from CO2 and H2O
  - similar evolutionary origin to mitochondria
- cytoskeleton
  - various types of filaments used for support and motility
  - microtubules support cell and serve as tracks for motor proteins to move
    - can offer compressive support
  - micofilaments are tensile only; well known for role in motility
    - most famously for muscle contraction
    - motor protens basically use ATP to repeatly bind/unbind and "walk"
    - intermediate filaments are permanent tensile fixtures for supporting shape
- plant cell walls are oriented in one direction and provide macro shape

Chapter 7 - Membrane Structure and Function

- fluid mosaic model says that membrane support free-flowing protein embedding
- fluidity affecting by lipid isomer structure
- types of embedded proteins:
  - transport
  - enzymatic
  - signal transduction
  - cell-cell recognition
  - intercellular joining
  - attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracelluar matrix
- membrane must regulate internal content of cell
- transport proteins can be active or passive
  - only active uses ATP to pump against gradient
- bulk transport occurs by exocytosis and endocytosis
  - membraine has to reach out and "consume" particles (or spit them out)

Chapter 8 - An Introduction to Metabolism

- everything in the world happens for one of two reasons:
  - reduce entropy within a system
  - expel energy to the surrounds
- Gibb's free energy determines whether reaction will occur
  - identifies the system's "useful" energy, and determined by entropy
- exergonic reactions still requiring triggering activation energy
- if a cell is in equilibrium, that means it is dead
- cells do three types of work:
  - chemical work (pushing endergonic reactions like polymer synthesis)
  - transport work (pumping)
  - mechanical work (actual movement)
- how ATP performs chemical work:
  - it energy released by exergoic ATP hydrolysis reaction
  - this heat drives normally endergonic reactions
  - note: seems like a pretty inefficient process
- how ATP performs transpsort work:
  - operate active transport protein by binding and then releasing key point
  - this causes pump to open/close selectively
  - bond to close pump then instantly hydrolyze to release
- how ATP performs mechanical work:
  - operate motor protein by binding and rebinding
  - causes one foot at a time on motor protein to move forward
  - bond to move forward pump then instantly hydrolyze, holding position
- ATP recylced by conversation to ADP + phosphate and back again
  - humans cycle nearly their body weight's worth of ATP each day
- ways that enzymes speed up reaction:
  - active sites place molecules in good position to bond
    - molecules held in place using weak interactions like hydrogen and ionic
  - provide favorable conditions like pH and temperature
- cofactors are nonpretein helpers which regulare activity
  - most vitamins act as cofactors or materials for cofactors
- enzyme inhibitors come in two types:
  - competitive: bind to enzyme at the normal substrate site
  - noncompetitive: bind somewhere else to deform enzyme, reducing effectiveness
- allosteric regulartion:
  - usually this means that regulatory molecule affects all subunits of enzyme
- many endproducts of metabolic pathway act as inhibitors for early enzymes
  - this is example of negative feedback

Chapter 9 - Cellular Respiration

- three types of metabolic pathways:
  - aerobic respiration
  - anaerobic respiration
  - fermentation
- redox == gaining an electron (losing charge), oxidation == losing electron
- energy released because electrons move to more electronegative compound
- oxygen extremely electronegative, hence useful for metabolism
- energy released in multiple intermediate steps
  - electron flows down "electron transport chain"
  - process consumes ATP but nets out more
- efficiency about 34% -- compared to 25% combustion engine
- crazy mechanical process:
  - electron transport train maintains a H+ gradient across membrace
  - H+ gradient used by ATP synthase, which is a mother****ing molecular mill
    - smallest molecular rotary motor known in nature
  - H+ causes synapse crank to turn, which activates catalytic sites
    - this somehow grinds ADP -> ATP
- anaerobic respiration used other electronegative compounds like sulfate
- fermentation stops after first step and is much less efficient
- hybernating animals turn off ATP but allow heat generation to continue
- ATP and other molecules both add as inhibitory feedback
- body produces most of the chmicals it needs save for 20 amino acids
  - regulated by "supply and demand" apparently...
