--- Interesting Points ---

- Energy/entropy should be considered in economics
- Organisms, cities/economies, companies scale by power laws of 0.75, 0.85, 0.9
  - Origins of cities and company power laws are never explained
- Wars/conflicts/murders are a continuous spectrum of scaled violence

- Organism scaling law determined by increasingly space-filling fractal dimensions
  - Metabolism is most prominent
  - Circulatory impedence matching implies economies of scale + fractal dimensions
  - Apparent need for only 3/4th terminal units like capillaries/mitochondria (why?)
- Maxmium aquatic mammal size dependent on growing area between capillaries
  - "Arcane" result of theory dictates distance grows with 1/12 exponent (why?)
- Organism lifetime and speed scales according to 0.25 power law
  - All mammals have ~1.5 billion heartbeats in lifetime
  - Scaling is probably determined by 0.25 distance (length^1 / length^4)
- Aging caused by wear and tear
  - Two main sources: viscous capillary friction + ATP production in mitochondria
  - Historical "low" life expectancies due to environment only
  - Caloric limiting beneficial under this theory

- One new NYC metropolitan area added to the world every two months
- City infrastructure scales sublinearly by 0.85
- Social phenomena (patents, wages, crime, pollution, disease) scales superlinearly by 1.15
- Infrastructure / social scaling perceived to be causally related
- Pace of life (walking/phone, etc) scales with smaller exponent up to physical constraint
- Mental problems hypothesized to be cause by hyperstimulation of city life
  - I like this theory
- People historically travel about an hour/day no matter what
  - Seems more like a statement on free-time than an actually interesting phenomenon
- Dunbar's number
  - Growing layers of social network connections
  - 5 very close friends, 15 closish friends, 50 friends, 150 acquiantances
  - Hypothesized to have neurological organisms
    - Skeptical about this... seems like a finiteness of time thing to me
- "Exponential singularity" pushed off by paradigm shifting innovation (why?)

- Company lifetime/revenues follow Zipf's law
- Companies scale sublinearly; more like organisms than cities
  - Independent of industry
  - Scaling limits analagous to organism growth limits -- point where input == maintanence
  - Grows exponentially until capital funding is spent then grows linearly
- Oldest companies are smaller, niche, and frequently Japanese
  - No attempt at explanations here so nothing to take away, unfortunately

--- Interesting Stories ---
  - Elephant LSD story
  - BMI and baby tylenol scaling pitfalls
  - Discovery of coastal fractal dimensions

--- Questions ---

- Why does the # of terminal units scaled with 3/4?
- laundry metaphor is a really bad metaphor (section on 4th dimension of life)
- 1/12th law - "arcane result"
- Exponential growth singularity staved off by paradigm-shifting innovations
